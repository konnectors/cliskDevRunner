# CliskDevRunner

Simple project to test clisk connectors with Playwright in an environment simulating React Native webview.

## Purpose and Context

This project runs with Node.js, Yarn and Playwright. In the `examples` folder, there are different test connectors. These are JavaScript files accompanied by manifests.

The goal is to allow developers to create clisk connectors with the lightest possible environment while staying as close as possible to the final environment, React Native webviews

## Main Features

- **React Native webview environment simulation** : The connector expects to connect via the post-me library. For this it expects to communicate with the outside via `window.ReactNativeWebView.postMessage`. So we need to expose this function which doesn't exist by default.

- **Custom Playwright messenger** : If you look at the post-me documentation, you need to create a Playwright-specific messenger that will be able to send messages to the connector in the page by injecting JavaScript that calls `window.postMessage`.

- **Console logs** : All console messages that arrive in the page are shown in the standard output of the program.

## Architecture

The project uses a multi-page architecture with:
- **Worker pages** : Pages where connectors are injected
- **Pilot pages** : Control pages to orchestrate tests
- **Post-me communication** : Messaging system between pages
- **Auto-reconnection** : Maintaining poste-me communication during navigation

## Installation

```bash
yarn install
```

## Launch

### Simplest handshake connector

To launch the project with the simplest handshake connector:

```bash
yarn start examples/handshake-konnector
```

### Other available connectors

```bash
# Minimal connector for debug
yarn start examples/minimal-konnector

# Evaluation connector
yarn start examples/evaluate-konnector

# Navigation connector
yarn start examples/goto-konnector

# Default connector (evaluate-konnector)
yarn start
```

## Debug

The project uses an advanced debug system with the `debug` library for filtered and modular logs. This allows you to precisely control what you want to see in the logs.

**ðŸ“– See [DEBUG.md](DEBUG.md) for a complete guide to the debug system.**

## Log Levels

The project supports different log levels to control verbosity according to your needs:

```bash
# Extreme logs (see everything)
npm run start:extreme

# Full logs (main flow)
npm run start:full

# Normal logs (essential)
npm run start:normal

# Quiet logs (minimal)
npm run start:quiet
```

**ðŸ“– See [LOG_LEVELS.md](LOG_LEVELS.md) for more details on log levels.**
